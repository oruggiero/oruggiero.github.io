                Hello!
            </h2>
            <p class="blurb">
                I’m a graduate student at Loyola University Chicago, originally from Danbury, CT. I’m pursuing a MA in Digital Humanities, and I hold a BA in Anthropology - also from Loyola University Chicago. In addition to my academic pursuits, I work in Campus Ministry on the THEA Institute project and as a musician.

            </h2>
            <p class="blurb">
                I hold a BA in Anthropology from Loyola University Chicago. My anthropology research interests focus on museums, art & material culture, and religion & ritual. As an undergraduate, I conducted a research project on a set of Cora festival masks (from Mexico) held in an ethnographic collection.

                I am currently pursuing a MA in <strong>Digital Humanities</strong> at Loyola University Chicago. My research focuses on digital museums and exhibits. In 2020, I worked with a team of fellow graduate students to produce a digital exhibit around two letters Emily Dickinson sent during the Civil War.

            <p class="blurb">
                I work in Campus Ministry’s THEA Institute. THEA runs innovative programs for high school students that sit at the intersection of environmental sustainability and theology. In my time with THEA, I co-created a new program: the THEA Fellowship. My work includes visual design, as well as traditional ministry work.
